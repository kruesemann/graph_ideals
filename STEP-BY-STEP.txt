%% Step-by-step guide

%% This is a step-by-step guide to build a complete database with Tinait.
%% The commands can be copy&pasted (even in chunks) into the console while executing the application.
%% This guides presumes an input file of graphs in Graph6 format named 'graphs.g6'
%%  and generates Macaulay2 scripts for the computation of Betti numbers of binomial edge ideals.
%% The latter requires 'template_bei_0.m2' and will add results in columns starting with 'bei'.
%% An input file with graphs in Graph6 format can be generated by nauty (available at http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/).
%% Example command for generating canonically labeled 4-graphs: './geng -l 4'

import -g6 graphs.g6
compute -allexcept
classify -allexcept
scripts bei -betti

%% Before the build can continue, Macaulay2 has to execute to generated scripts (available at http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/).
%% Example command for executing the 4th generated script: './M2 0_<datetime>_bei_3.m2'
